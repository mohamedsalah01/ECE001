	<h2> Internet Of Things Applications</h2>
	<p>The list of IoT applications will grow as technology evolves in the years ahead. In the near future, IoT will 
	likely be used with Artificial intelligence to give smart solutions. Here we introduce some important real-world IoT 
	Examples of applications.</p>
	<dl>
	<dt><h3>Smart Homes</h3></dt>
	<dd>
		<img width="600" src="smart-homes.jpg">
		<p>Smart homes are most trendy among these applications. The vision of a smart home is to control home appliances 
		including lights, water flow from taps home security and safety.</p>
		<p>House owner gets access to control and monitor these actions from their smart devices (smartphones, tablets, 
		laptops). Imagine a situation that you forgot to turn off a water tap, you are already out of your home. You can 
		just turn off from your phone.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt><h3>Smart Cars</h3></dt>
	<dd>
		<img width="600" src="smart-cars.jpg">
		<p>Just like science fiction, can you imagine controlling all the functionalities of your car by your smartphone? 
		Having on board a smart computer that programs all your preferences; integrated sensors to alert mechanical assistance; 
		and even a system capable of driving the car for you?
		All these are not fiction anymore, within a few years you can see such cars on the road.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt><h3>Smart city</h3></dt>
	<dd>
		<img width="600" src="smart-city.png">
		<p>Smart City or "City of the Future" is a concept that classifies technology as responsible for offering improvements 
		in urban infrastructure to make urban centers more efficient, cheaper and better to live in.</p>
		<p>The concept of "Smart City" addresses planning and public administration through the automation of services in a 
		creative and sustainable way. The sectors that have been developing smart cities include government services, 
		transport and traffic management, energy, health care, water, innovative urban agriculture, and waste management</p>
	</dd>
	<dt><h3>IoT in farming</h3></dt>
	<dd>
		<img width="600" src="iot-in-farming.jpg">
		<p>Farmers can use intelligent IoT farming applications to optimize many distinct operations, such as determining the 
		best time to harvest crops, generating soil chemistry-based fertilizer profiles and detecting soil nutrients and 
		moisture concentrations.</p>
		<p>A series of sensors should be installed throughout the agriculture, sensors connected to animals can help control 
		livestock. For example, a microchip is placed in the ox's ear to track the animal, informing its vaccine history, 
		among other information.</p>
